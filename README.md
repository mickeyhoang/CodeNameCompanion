This is the digital version of the cardgame CodeNames. mickeyhoang.github.io/codename

To play this game display the website on a screen shared with the group. Split the group into two teams with a leader on each team. Each leader should open this site on their own phones: mickeyhoang.github.io./codenamecompanion

Choose a random seed number and use that same number for the main CodeNames page and the leaders' companion pages.

Instructions to play: 1.) Insert same seed number on all sites. 2.) Each team chooses a different color, Red or Blue 3.) Leader's job is to look at the colors on the companion app and see which word blocks correspond to the teams color. 4.) Leader is allowed to say one word and one number, one word that relates to several cards on the screen and one number to say how many cards are related. 5.) Group's goal is to choose the right cards that they believe the leader is describing 6.) First team to reveal all their cards wins 7.) Revealing a gray card ends the turn, revealing a black card is instant loss
